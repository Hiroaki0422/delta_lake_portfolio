# Databricks Data Lakehouse with Delta Lake

## About This Project  
This project represents a major modernization initiative I led at my previous company. The goal was to upgrade our existing cloud data lake by introducing Databricks' Lakehouse architecture — specifically leveraging Delta Lake — to replace slow, inconsistent Parquet-based pipelines.

I was responsible for the full technical implementation:  
- Migrated batch ingestion to Delta format  
- Optimized partitioning and enabled Z-Ordering  
- Cataloged processed data in Delta Lake for easy access by data scientists and ML engineers  

As a result, OLAP query speeds improved by **50x–100x**, and data replication lag dropped from hours to under a minute. Business teams were able to access near real-time insights directly through the Databricks platform.

While the codebase remains private due to proprietary constraints, I’d like to share the high-level architecture and the impact this migration delivered.

## Challenges with the Existing Data Lake  
Our legacy data lake used AWS S3 to store CDC (Change Data Capture) data replicated from a NoSQL MongoDB database. While cost-effective compared to a data warehouse, the lake relied on Parquet format — which doesn't support row-level inserts or updates.  

This meant that even small changes required regenerating entire tables — an expensive and inefficient process, especially as data volume reached terabyte scale. Partitioning grew out of control, and daily batch jobs became the only practical way to keep data up to date.

## The Solution: Delta Lake Integration  
To address these challenges, I led the effort to implement Delta Lake on the Databricks platform.  

Delta format solves the update/insert issue by adding transactional support (via log files) on top of Parquet, enabling ACID-compliant operations and faster incremental updates.

## What I Built  
I redesigned the entire pipeline and introduced a scalable, cost-efficient architecture:
- Developed an incremental ingestion pipeline that updates Delta tables without recomputing the full dataset  
- Replaced batch processing with an event-driven microservice architecture  
- Implemented fine-grained access control using data catalogs and user groups, allowing teams to analyze data using Databricks notebooks and manage their own tables securely

## Business Impact  
- **Replication lag reduced:** from 24 hours → **< 1 hour**  
- **Efficient computation:** significant cost savings by avoiding full table recomputation  
- **OLAP performance:** SQL queries ran **50x–100x faster** after migration to Databricks  
- **Empowered teams:** streamlined data access for analysts and ML engineers
